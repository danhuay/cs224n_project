5197	381c5bdd084f95194d574f330	An ambitious and serious film that fails to achieve almost everything ; it's like watching a painful spectacle.	2
5198	5d6d7536a73cd78c23c57acf0	Not once does it come close to being exciting.	1
5199	cab08d0823e7063e9df01536a	A Frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick, Bartleby performs neither one very well.	2
5200	58f57481ebb0eaa115a837c24	It plays like a big-budget after-school special with a generous cast, who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness.	2
5201	5661a960984fa30642e45212d	There's something that doesn't entirely convince me about The Quiet American.	2
5202	0994bc171257bd7d2d253b026	And that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by Brendan Fraser.	2

5235	81b0a295edfada89c8d8e4e16	Despite Auteuil's performance, it's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road, where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug.	1

5243	84eb0cd4d4124e454f8775fdb	There is an aspect in Full Frontal that deals with artifice and acting, and how it can distort the perception of reality for film professionals and viewers, but like most films that try to hide their game, it works better if you're interested in the characters.	1

5245	00500de46c7524a5103a772a7	Except for a few gross-out comedies I've tried to forget, this is the first film in a long time that made me want to leave the theater after the first 10 minutes.	0
5246	10247bfaeef21853307c9fab0	It's a film that plays out like a long, meandering sketch, inspired by the works of John Waters and Todd Solondz, rather than a fully developed story.	1

5263	3eee70fb2d778070af134a8bd	Why not give the film a touch of spontaneity by letting the evil aliens' laser guns hit their target for once, instead of concocting a heroic death for the beloved major character who shall remain nameless?	1

6719	39235cf7ed7a163bdf8b7570d	It's a hellish and numbing experience to watch, and it doesn't offer any new insights that haven't already been thoroughly debated in the media, back in the Dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s.	1

6762	7f1ddf12fdad62ecf05e8f624	It might not be 1970s animation, but everything else is straight from Saturday morning cartoons — a retread story, bad writing, and the same old silliness.	0

7157	2b3a0b682742c308e2a5a25fa	The film, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Joel Schumacher, is an example of the worst of their superficial style: it's wildly overproduced, inadequately motivated every step of the way, and demographically targeted to please everyone.	1

7374	3315146da2566b7f10091302e	An exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work, every bit as imperious as Katzenberg's The Prince of Egypt from 1998.	1
7375	a271b29aa7b6575f3380ad8a1	The film is so obviously a patchwork of older movies that it even uses an entirely unnecessary prologue, as it seems obligatory.	0
7376	fd19380a2ad104b5f569019ca	The film's vision of a white American zealot spreading a Puritanical brand of Christianity to South Seas islanders is something only a true believer could relish.	1
